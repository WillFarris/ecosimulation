## Project Description
This project is an ecosystem simulation written in Rust. When the simulation starts, several critters and food sources populate the map. Critters move, eat, and mate.  Moving decreases energy, and eating increases it. If a critter runs out of energy completely, it dies. 

Critters (in red and pink) have several traits: speed, size, and eyesight. The pink critters are seeking a mate. 
The critters' ability to conserve energy is inversely related to speed.
